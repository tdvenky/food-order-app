food-order-app allows users to add menu items to the cart, view the cart and place an order. An order contains menu items with user information such as name and address. After successfully placing an order, an order ID is displayed to the user.

This is a React project and the website is hosted on google firebase. The menu items are being fetched from the firebase realtime database and the orders are posted to it as well. A custom react hook - useAxios() is being used to make the GET and POST requests.
